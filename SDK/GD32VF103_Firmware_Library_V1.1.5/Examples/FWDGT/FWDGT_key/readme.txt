  This demo is based on the GD32V103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to reload the 
FWDGT counter at regulate period using the EXTI interrupt. The FWDGT timeout 
is set to 1.6s (the timeout may varies due to IRC40K frequency dispersion).
 
  An EXTI is connected to a specific GPIO pin and configured to generate an interrupt
on its falling edge: when the EXTI Line interrupt is triggered (by pressing the Wakeup
Key on the board), the corresponding interrupt is served. In the ISR, FWDGT counter is 
reloaded). 

  If the EXTI Line interrupt does not occur, the FWDGT counter is not reloaded before
the FWDGT counter reaches 00h, and the FWDGT reset. 

  There are three operation methods as follow:
  1.After the download is completed and the system is powered on, LED2 flashes once and 
then LED3 starts flashing.

  2.After the download is completed and the system is powered on, start to press the B 
button in quick succession, then LED2 is always on, and stop pressing the wake button in
quick succession and LED3 starts to flash.

  3.After the download is completed and the system is powered on, LED2 flashes once and then 
LED3 starts flashing. At this time, after pressing the B button in rapid succession, 
LED3 is always on, and after stopping the rapid and continuous pressing of the wake button,
LED3 starts flashing.
